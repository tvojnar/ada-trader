To make the orders section:

1. Need to have a model and collection for the orders
      ~ when the form is filled out it creates a new instance of the Order model and is added to the OrderList collection
2. the Open Orders view renders the OrderList collection
    ~ when you hit 'cancel' it destroys the Order instance so no one will be listening to that instance anymore
    ~ have an attribute for the Order instances that match the sumbol for the quote so I can still use custom 'matching' event names to pair an Order with a Quote to know when to make the Order go though depending on the price change
3. To get the data to the form from the Quotes the form will be passed a list of the names of all of the Quotes to populate the drop down. Then when a new Order is created it checks that the 'waiting price' for that Order is ok compared to the current price of the Quote with a matching name.
